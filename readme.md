# JSTalks - Blazor demos

This repo holds the code for the demos that were shown on the **Why JavaScript when you can see sharp** session, held at the [JSTalks 18](http://jstalks.net/) conference in Sofia.

There are three demos:

- Basic Blazor functionalities ([BlazorBasic](https://github.com/sweko/jstalks-blazor/tree/master/BlazorBazic))
- Client / Server Blazor demo ([ExpressServer](https://github.com/sweko/jstalks-blazor/tree/master/ExpressServer) for the server code and [BlazorClient](https://github.com/sweko/jstalks-blazor/tree/master/BlazorClient) for the client-side code)
- JavaScript Interop examples ([BlazorJsInterop](https://github.com/sweko/jstalks-blazor/tree/master/BlazorJsInterop))

To run the examples, you need to have [Blazor](https://blazor.net/docs/get-started.html) installed.
